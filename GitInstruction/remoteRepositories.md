## Working with remote repositories:
1. Create account in GitHub
2. Create a local repository
3. "Befriend" your local and remote repositories. GitHub will advice you how to do it when craeting a new repository.
4. Send (push) your local repostiry to the remote one (on GitHub). Probably, you will need to authorize yourself on the remote reopsitory.
5. Make some changes from another computer.
6. Retrive (pull) the updated condition from the remote repository.

## Contiributing to someone else's repository:
1. Create a fork of the repository we are interested in.
2. We do a git clone of the forked repository.
3. Create a separate branch for changes.
4. Do all the changes in that branch.
5. Send those changes to our account (push).
6. We'll be able to create the pull request in our GitHub.
