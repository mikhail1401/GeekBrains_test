## Text highlighting

To highlight a text in italics, you need to enclose it with asterisks (*) or with the undescore sign (_).
For example, *Like this* or _like this_.

To highlight a text in bold, you need to enclose it with double asterisks (**) or with double underscore signs (__).

For example, **Like this** or __like this__.

Alternative options of highlighting a text with italics or bold are needed in order to combine both of these options. 
For example, _a text can be italicized and **be bold** at the same time_
